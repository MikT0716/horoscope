                <h3>Aquarius</h3>After a long period of helping the people you love, it is perfectly okay to want to
                put
                yourself first today! There's no need to feel guilty. Instead, plan out your day with your happiness
                as
                your
                only goal. Choose a nice variety of your favorite things, and toss in a little splurge here or there
                just
                for good measure. You've proved yourself to be a good friend and a good partner. Now it's time to
                give
                some
                of that goodness to yourself!</p>

                <h3>Aries</h3>Controversy will be your ally today. It will create a nice, loud, distracting noise
                that
                will keep everyone busy -- and out of your hair! You will need all the elbow room and autonomy you
                can
                get today, as it's the perfect day to put new ideas to work. Get in some of that research, planning
                or
                organizing you need to do as early in the day as possible. By late afternoon, people could be
                hovering
                around you again, looking for the answers only you can give.</p>

                <h3>Cancer</h3>Other people have expectations of you right now, whether you like it or not. It's a fact,
                and you should accept it -- and learn how to react to it. This isn't a situation in which you should
                wait for orders to follow. You should take some initiative and show them that you're even more
                outstanding than they are expecting you to be. You have some amazing talents that have only been hinted
                at. This is a big chance to improve your (already stellar) reputation.</p>

                <h3>Capricorn</h3>When it becomes dramatically clear that you can't do it all today, you'll have to let
                go of some of your obligations. But this is very good news -- and it will send a message to someone
                powerful that you are not superhuman. Adjusting expectations is important, and doing so is sometimes
                necessary if you want to keep harmony in your life. You'd do well to let go of some of your own
                expectations of someone close to you. The fact that the two of you are not always on the same page isn't
                a problem.</p>

                <h3>Gemini</h3>Today your energy is so bright and engaging that it's downright obnoxious -- so
                naturally, the world will be taking special notice of you! Expect some advances from people who might
                not care whether you are single or not. Put an end to any uncomfortable situations as soon as they
                start. Silence may be seen as compliance, so be sure to speak up if you're feeling uncomfortable or
                manipulated. The good news is that you are also attracting friends to spend more time with you. Get
                ready for a reunion.</p>

                <h3>Leo</h3>Acting your age won't feel like much fun today -- the children in your life are having a
                great time, so why can't you? Asking this question will lead you to a realization that you can do
                whatever you want to do! Take this attitude with you wherever you go today. You don't always have to be
                willing to grow up in order to be in charge. The world could use some of your immature ideas, so lead by
                example and have some fun. Laughter is a great way to get noticed.</p>

                <h3>Libra</h3>Sometimes the hardest thing to do in life is to do nothing at all. Taking your hands off
                the steering wheel may seem like a dangerous thing to do, but in actuality right now it could be your
                best tactic (not literally, of course!). Let things take their natural course at work, at school and in
                a new relationship. You have less control over things than you think you do, so just admit that and take
                yourself off the hook. You don't have to fix anything. It's the way it's meant to be.</p>

                life so you can make room for something else to come in is a difficult choice to make -- after all, how
                can you be certain that what is coming will be better than what is leaving? Rely on your faith in the
                people involved, and trust that they know what is best in this situation. If all else fails, just
                remember that moving forward is better than standing still.</p>

                can to exchange your ideas clearly. Emails are more about convenience than they are about truly
                connecting with another person. So if you are building a romance online, it's time to stop the back and
                forth and schedule a good old-fashioned date. It's the only way to move things forward on solid footing.
                You need to get someone's attention to finish a conversation that started a few days ago.</p>

                your last nerve, today is the day to stop the madness. Do whatever you can to remove this person from
                the picture -- even if it means you have to remove yourself from their environment. It might be a good
                idea to get off on your own for a while, regardless. You could use a little time to slow down the pace
                of your life and just watch the world swirl around you.</p>

                thing as a sure thing. Renewal is in the air right now, and you can easily grab some of it to get your
                own thing going if you stay dedicated. Whatever idea or scheme you've been playing with is more possible
